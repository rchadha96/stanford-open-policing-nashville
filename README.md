# Title: Analysis of the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department’s Traffic Stop Practices using R

•	Analysed over 3 million traffic stops with 42 features under the supervision of Dr. Niamh Cahill to determine if Racial Profiling exists. Utilized statistical techniques to conclude that African Americans were arrested and searched 16.3% higher compared to other drivers.
•	Implemented and explored Machine Learning Regression Models such as Logistic Regression, General Additive Model and Bayesian Hierarchal Model to identify key attributes and investigate comparative results in order to refine best performing model. 
•	Achieved an accuracy of 95% using Bayesian Hierarchical model, successfully predicting search and arrest trends depending on drivers’ race.
